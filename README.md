Todidnt
====

(:construction: This project is currently under construction! :construction:)

Todidnt is a command line utility to help you track down TODOs and FIXMEs that 
you always said you'd do but haven't actually done yet. It also generates pages
(rdoc-style) to show you things like pretty graphs of your repository TODOs over
time.
